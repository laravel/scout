# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading To 10.0 From 9.x

### Minimum Versions

The following dependency versions have been updated:

- The minimum PHP version is now v8.0
- The minimum Laravel version is now v9.0

### The `getScoutKeyName` Method

PR: https://github.com/laravel/scout/pull/509

In Scout 10.x, the `getScoutKeyName` method will return the unqualified key name and no longer qualifies the key name with the table name. If you are overriding the `getScoutKeyName` method you will need to account for this change and make sure you return an unqualified key name.

```diff
public function getScoutKeyName()
{
-    return 'posts.id';
+    return 'id';
}
```

### Removal Of `getUnqualifiedScoutKeyName`

PR: https://github.com/laravel/scout/pull/657

Due to the `getScoutKeyName` change discussed above, the `getUnqualifiedScoutKeyName` method was removed as it is no longer necessary.

### Meilisearch 1.0

Scout 10.x requires Meilisearch PHP 1.0 as its minimum supported SDK version; therefore, you should upgrade your dependency via your application's `composer.json` file:

```json
"meilisearch/meilisearch-php": "^1.0",
```

In this SDK update, all namespace and class references to "MeiliSearch" have been updated to "Meilisearch". Please review your code for any reference to the old capitalization and update those references accordingly.

In addition, please consult the full [Meilisearch PHP v1.0 changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-php/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for further details.
